<h3>
MWOSD GUI configurator - MWOSD 1.7 onwards
</h3>
<p>The GUI for configuring MWOSD is available for a nominal fee at the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mwosd-configurator/jdfbjgomfcfpgkdjfnmekbkhkbgfminf?hl=en">google chrome store</a>.</p>
<h5>Why is the OSD source code free, but the GUI not?</h5> - The OS vendors announced a while ago their intention to withdraw support for some functions used by the legacy "Processing" based GUI. 
To free up development time for the OSD and have a more up to date, reliable and faster operating GUI, 
the MWOSD repository owner took the decision to work with a developer who would create a suitable replacement 1.6 GUI FOC and provide a supported one in the future at minimal cost. 
The GUI configurator is built from the ground up purely for MWOSD and will not be open sourced, however the files are available to the MWOSD repository owner to inpsect and make changes if necessary.
